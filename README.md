# WWT Tour Authoring Guide: Source Code

This repository contains the source code for the [WWT Tour Authoring Guide].
The `master` branch of this repo gets published here:

### https://docs.worldwidetelescope.org/tour-authoring-guide/1/

[WWT Tour Authoring Guide]: https://docs.worldwidetelescope.org/tour-authoring-guide/1/

If you’re just interested in the documentation itself, you should go to that
website. If you’re interested in *contributing* to this documentation, you’ve
come to the right place!


## Quick Start for the Initiated

The guide is a static site written in [CommonMark Markdown] and processed
with [Zola]. Zola is distributed as a single executable so it is ridiculously
[easy to install][install-zola].

This repository is themed by referencing [zola-wwtguide] as a submodule, so
upon first checkout you’ll have to run:

```
git submodule update --init
```

Once everything is set up, all you have to do is run

```
zola serve
```

to build the site and serve it locally for testing. The command `zola check`
will check the build and verify that outgoing links are valid. Zola has
[lots of documentation][zola-docs].

Merges to `master` will be published automatically using WWT’s continuous
deployment infrastructure.
